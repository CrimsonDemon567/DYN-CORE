DYN-CORE – CPU Architecture Specification v4.1.1 (Unified Edition)
(Biomimetic SiC Epitaxy • Monolithic Substrate • Topological Transport)
================================================================

0. OVERVIEW
-----------
DYN-CORE v4.1.1 defines a monolithic Silicon Carbide (SiC) processor 
grown through DNA-guided biomimetic epitaxy. This revision unifies the 
substrate-level innovations of the SiC monolith with formal logic 
invariants, a Multi-Seed growth strategy, and Topological Transducers 
for standardized I/O coupling.

The result is a permanent, radiation-immune, high-integrity SiC 
computing crystal capable of ballistic, topologically protected 
wave-logic execution with deterministic behavior enforced by the 
DYN-CORE Logic Core (I1–I4).

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. FORMAL INVARIANTS (Logic Core)
---------------------------------
These invariants are hardware-enforced by the lattice geometry:

I1 — Divergence Bound:
    |div(T)| ≤ div_max OR T → Sink-Node (Entropy Drain)

I2 — Atomicity:
    No Primary Topology update occurs without Shadow-State validation.

I3 — Mandatory Unlock:
    No LOCKED resonance geometry may persist without a guaranteed exit path.

I4 — Temporal Progress:
    Every execution path must commit, yield, or terminate within Δt_max.

These invariants ensure correctness, determinism, and deadlock freedom.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. MOLECULAR SYNTHESIS LAYER (Substrate v4.1.1)
-----------------------------------------------
The SiC substrate is produced through a hybrid biological–chemical 
growth process optimized for atomic precision and defect minimization.

2.1 Multi-Seed DNA-Guided LbL Epitaxy
A biomimetic mineralization process for accelerated crystal growth:
• DNA-Origami Scaffold: 
  A 3D DNA lattice defines atomic coordinates for Si/C precursor binding.

• Multi-Seed Parallax: 
  Millions of DNA seed-points initiate simultaneous growth, ensuring 
  rapid crystallization and high lattice homogeneity.
• Calcination: 
  A thermal cycle removes the organic scaffold, leaving a pure 4H-SiC 
  or 6H-SiC polytype with minimal lattice defects.

2.2 Surface Passivation (Inorganic Shield)
A permanent 2 nm protective coating:
• Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) or Silicon Nitride (Si3N4).
• Ensures oxidation resistance and integrity up to 1200K.
• Protects against cosmic-ray displacement and ionizing radiation.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. TOPOLOGICAL TRANSPORT & I/O
---------------------------------------
The SiC monolith supports ballistic, topologically protected wave-logic.

3.1 Ballistic Wave-Logic
Carriers propagate as coherent wavefunctions through the ultra-ordered 
SiC lattice. LbL epitaxy minimizes phonon scattering, enabling 
near-zero resistance and stable long-range coherence.

3.2 Shadow-State Execution (Resonance)
Computation occurs in interference zones:
• Shadow-State: Transient wave-interference encoding results.
• Primary-State: Validated state stored in lattice-vacancy memory.
Promotion from Shadow → Primary requires I2 validation.

3.3 Topological Transducers (I/O Bridge)
Interface layers translate internal coherent wave-logic into external 
digital signals. These transducers manage impedance matching between 
the ballistic medium and conventional electronic peripherals.

3.4 Vacancy-Site Storage (V_Si Memory)
Specific silicon vacancies serve as quantum-stable memory cells and 
resonant anchors integrated directly into transport pathways.


----------------------------------------------------------------

4. EXECUTION & THERMAL MANAGEMENT
---------------------------------
4.1 Isothermal Operation
SiC’s thermal conductivity (370–490 W/m·K) ensures instantaneous 
heat dissipation and zero thermal gradients across the monolith.

4.2 Sink-Node Entropy Drain
Any violation of I1–I4 triggers immediate wave-steering into 
destructive interference zones (Sink-Nodes), preventing logical 
corruption and thermal runaway.
