DYN-CORE – CPU Architecture Specification v4.1.1 (Unified Edition)
(Biomimetic SiC Epitaxy • Monolithic Substrate • Protein-Templated)
================================================================

0. OVERVIEW
-----------
DYN-CORE v4.1.1 defines a monolithic Silicon Carbide (SiC) processor 
grown through de-novo protein-templated biomimetic epitaxy. This revision 
replaces organic DNA-scaffolding with high-affinity recombinant protein 
matrices, unifying substrate-level innovations with formal logic 
invariants and Topological Transducers for standardized I/O coupling.

The result is a permanent, radiation-immune SiC computing crystal 
capable of ballistic wave-logic execution with deterministic behavior 
enforced by the DYN-CORE Logic Core (I1–I4).

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. FORMAL INVARIANTS (Logic Core)
---------------------------------
Hardware-enforced by the lattice geometry and wavefront interference:

I1 — Divergence Bound:
    |div(T)| ≤ div_max OR T → Sink-Node (Coherent Entropy Drain).

I2 — Atomicity:
    No Primary Topology update occurs without Shadow-State resonance validation.

I3 — Mandatory Unlock:
    No LOCKED resonance geometry may persist without a guaranteed topological exit.

I4 — Temporal Progress:
    Every execution path must commit, yield, or terminate within Δt_max.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. MOLECULAR SYNTHESIS LAYER (Substrate v4.1.1)
-----------------------------------------------
The SiC substrate is produced through Protein-Templated Biomineralization (PTB) 
optimized for Ångström-level precision.

2.1 Recombinant Protein-Templated Epitaxy (PTB)
A low-energy, high-precision growth process:
• De-novo Protein Scaffold: 
  Engineered Chaperone-Proteins with high-affinity binding sites for 
  Si/C precursors. The protein fold defines the 4H-SiC lattice constants.
• Multi-Seed Fermentation: 
  Recombinant proteins are produced via microbial fermentation, allowing 
  mass-scale "seeding" in aqueous solutions at cent-level costs.
• Directed Calcination: 
  A controlled thermal cycle removes the protein matrix, leaving a 
  monolithic 4H-SiC polytype with intrinsic lattice-vacancy patterns.

2.2 Surface Passivation (Inorganic Shield)
A permanent 2 nm protective coating:
• Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) or Silicon Nitride (Si3N4).
• Ensures integrity up to 1200K and immunity to ionizing radiation.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. TOPOLOGICAL TRANSPORT & I/O
---------------------------------------
3.1 Ballistic Wave-Logic
Carriers propagate as coherent wavefunctions through the ultra-ordered 
SiC lattice. PTB minimizes phonon scattering, enabling near-zero 
thermal resistance and stable long-range coherence.

3.2 Shadow-State Execution (Resonance)
Computation occurs in interference zones:
• Shadow-State: Transient wave-interference encoding intermediate results.
• Primary-State: Validated state stored in lattice-vacancy memory.
Promotion from Shadow → Primary requires I2 (Atomicity) validation.

3.3 Topological Transducers (I/O Bridge)
Piezo-electronic interface layers translate internal coherent 
wave-logic into external digital signals (impedance matching).

3.4 Vacancy-Site Storage (V_Si Memory)
Silicon vacancies serve as quantum-stable memory cells and 
resonant anchors integrated directly into the transport pathways.

----------------------------------------------------------------

4. EXECUTION & THERMAL MANAGEMENT
---------------------------------
4.1 Isothermal Operation
High thermal conductivity (370–490 W/m·K) ensures instantaneous 
heat dissipation across the monolith.

4.2 Sink-Node Entropy Drain
Violation of I1–I4 triggers immediate wave-steering into 
destructive interference zones (Sink-Nodes), preventing logical 
corruption and thermal runaway.
