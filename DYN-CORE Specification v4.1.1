DYN-CORE – CPU Architecture Specification v4.1.1 (Unified Edition)
(Biomimetic SiC Epitaxy • Monolithic Substrate • Topological Transport)
================================================================

0. OVERVIEW
-----------
DYN-CORE v4.1.1 defines a monolithic Silicon Carbide (SiC) processor
grown through DNA-guided biomimetic epitaxy. This revision unifies the
substrate-level innovations of the SiC monolith with the formal logic
invariants and wave-logic execution model introduced in earlier versions.

The result is a permanent, radiation-immune, high-integrity SiC
computing crystal capable of ballistic, topologically protected
wave-logic execution with deterministic behavior enforced by the
DYN-CORE Logic Core (I1–I4).

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. FORMAL INVARIANTS (Logic Core)
---------------------------------
These invariants apply regardless of substrate or execution medium.

I1 — Divergence Bound:
    |div(T)| ≤ div_max OR T → Sink-Node (Entropy Drain)

I2 — Atomicity:
    No Primary Topology update occurs without Shadow-State validation.

I3 — Mandatory Unlock:
    No LOCKED resonance geometry may persist without a guaranteed exit path.

I4 — Temporal Progress:
    Every execution path must commit, yield, or terminate within Δt_max.

These invariants ensure correctness, determinism, and deadlock freedom.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. MOLECULAR SYNTHESIS LAYER (Substrate v4.1.1)
-----------------------------------------------
The SiC substrate is produced through a hybrid biological–chemical
growth process optimized for atomic precision and defect minimization.

2.1 DNA-Guided Layer-by-Layer (LbL) Epitaxy
A biomimetic mineralization process forms the monolithic SiC lattice:
• DNA-Origami Scaffold:
  A 3D DNA lattice defines atomic coordinates for Si/C precursor binding.
• Layer-by-Layer Deposition:
  Precursor ions are sequestered and deposited in controlled sequences,
  forming a 4H-SiC or 6H-SiC polytype with minimal lattice defects.
• Calcination:
  A thermal cycle removes the organic scaffold, leaving a pure SiC crystal.

2.2 Surface Passivation (Inorganic Shield)
A transient S-Layer protein shell guides deposition of a permanent
2 nm protective coating:
• Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC), or
• Silicon Nitride (Si3N4)

This ensures:
• Oxidation resistance
• Structural integrity up to 1200K
• Protection against cosmic-ray displacement damage

2.3 Monolithic Silicon Carbide Matrix
• Hardness: Mohs 9.5 (covalent Si–C bonding)
• Bandgap: 3.2 eV (wide bandgap, zero leakage)
• Radiation Hardness: Intrinsic immunity to EMP and ionizing radiation
• Thermal Stability: No structural or electronic drift across 0K–1200K

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. TOPOLOGICAL TRANSPORT (Supra-Medium)
---------------------------------------
The SiC monolith supports ballistic, topologically protected wave-logic.

3.1 Ballistic Wave-Logic
Carriers propagate as coherent wavefunctions through the ultra-ordered
SiC lattice. LbL epitaxy minimizes phonon scattering, enabling
near-zero resistance and stable long-range coherence.

3.2 Resonant Interference (Shadow-State Execution)
Computation occurs in interference zones:
• Shadow-State:
  A transient wave-interference pattern encoding the computational result.
• Primary-State:
  A validated, committed state stored in lattice-vacancy memory.

Promotion from Shadow → Primary requires I2 validation.

3.3 Vacancy-Site Storage (V_Si Memory)
Specific silicon vacancies serve as:
• Quantum-stable memory cells
• Resonant anchors for wave-logic
• Long-term storage sites integrated directly into transport pathways

----------------------------------------------------------------

4. EXECUTION & THERMAL MANAGEMENT
---------------------------------
4.1 Isothermal Operation
SiC’s thermal conductivity (370–490 W/m·K) ensures:
• Instantaneous heat dissipation
• Uniform temperature across the monolith
• No thermal gradients affecting logic behavior

4.2 Sink-Node Entropy Drain
Any violation of I1–I4 triggers immediate wave-steering into
destructive interference zones (Sink-Nodes), preventing:
• Logical corruption
• Thermal runaway
• Metastable states
